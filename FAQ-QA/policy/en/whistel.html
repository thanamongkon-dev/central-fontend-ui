        2. Conditions and Considerations for Handling Reports and Complaints
      </h2>
      <ol class="pl-6 list-decimal">
        <li>
          The details of the report or complaint must be truthful, clear, or
          sufficient to facilitate the investigation and proceed with further
          actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whistleblowers or complainants may choose not to disclose their name,
          address, or contact number if they believe that such disclosure may
          compromise their safety or cause any harm. However, if they choose to
          identify themselves, the company will be able to provide progress
          updates, request additional useful information, clarify the facts, or
          address damages more conveniently and promptly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whistleblowers or complainants will be granted protection of their
          rights, whether they are employees of the company or external
          individuals.
        </li>
        <li>
          The time required to process a complaint depends on the complexity of
          the matter, the sufficiency of the documents and evidence provided by
          the complainant, as well as the documents and explanations provided by
          the accused party.
        </li>
        <li>
          The recipient of the complaint and those involved in the fact-finding
          process must keep all relevant information confidential. It will only
          be disclosed as necessary, taking into account the safety and
          potential harm to the complainant, the person cooperating in the
          investigation, the source of the information, or any individuals
          involved.
        </li>
        <li>
          In cases where the complainant or individuals cooperating in the
          fact-finding process feel that they may face safety risks or potential
          harm, they may request the company to implement appropriate protective
          measures. Alternatively, the company may take the initiative to
          establish protective measures without the request of the complainant
          or the cooperating individual if it is deemed likely that harm or
          safety risks could occur.
        </li>
        <li>
          Individuals who have suffered harm or damage will receive appropriate
          and fair remediation through a proper process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Anyone who reports false information or maliciously accuses others may
          be subject to disciplinary action or legal penalties as applicable.

        3. Protection of the rights of employees, workers, or other individuals
        contracted to work for the company
      </h2>
      <p>
        The company will not take any unfair actions against directors,
        executives, employees, workers, or other individuals contracted to work
        for the company, whether by changing their job position, work
        responsibilities, or workplace, suspending them, intimidating them,
        disrupting their work, terminating their employment, or taking any other
        action that constitutes unfair treatment due to the individual's actions
        or involvement.
      </p>
      <ul class="pl-6 list-decimal">
        <li>
          To report if you observe an event or activity that is suspected to be
          a violation, fraudulent, or non-compliant with laws, regulations,
          rules, codes of conduct, or corporate governance policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          To report information, provide assistance, or cooperate in any way
          with directors, executives, government agencies, or regulatory bodies
          for the purpose of consideration or investigation in cases where there
          is suspicion of a violation or non-compliance with laws, regulations,
          codes of conduct, or corporate governance policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          The company rejects corruption and fraudulent activities, even if such
          actions may result in the loss of business opportunities. The company
          will keep the information received confidential and will not disclose
          the identity of the whistleblower or complainant to the public without
          consent, unless required by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          False complaints: The complainant must act in good faith and without
          the intent to maliciously harm the organization or individuals. If the
          whistleblowing or complaint contains statements or information that
          can be proven to be dishonest, false, groundless, or intended to
          maliciously target the organization or individuals, the company will
          take appropriate action according to the company's procedures or
          applicable laws.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you witness any actions that may violate the Code of Conduct, please
    report the complaint through the online reporting system. This channel
    allows employees or external individuals to report any actions that may be
    contrary to the company's business practices.
