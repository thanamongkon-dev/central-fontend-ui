        <li>If you receive a notification on the order details page that the Check and Return service is available for your order, you may open and inspect your order upon delivery. You need to inform the Central Online delivery provider immediately if you decide to use this service and return your order at the delivery location.</li>
        <li>
            <p>By using the Check and Return service, you agree to comply with the following conditions (Inspection and Return Conditions):</p>
            <ul class="pl-6 list-disc">
                <li>You will open and inspect your order in the presence of the shipping provider and permit a video recording during the unboxing process. For details on how this video may be handled, please refer to <a class="text-blue-500 underline" href="https://www.central.co.th/en/information/faqs/check-and-return-service">Central Online's privacy policy.</a></li>
                <li>You will not open or damage the manufacturer's packaging, including any seals or stickers. If you violate this condition, the order will be considered successfully delivered, and you must pay for that order. However, you may still return and request a refund according to the <a class="text-blue-500 underline" href="https://prod-web.central.co.th/en/faqs/return-refund-policy">return policy.</a></li>
                <li>You will inspect the goods solely to confirm their correctness or identify defects. You will not test or use the goods. If you violate this condition, the order will be deemed successfully delivered, and you must pay for the order.</li>
                <li>You will receive an electronic receipt (E-receipt) for the Check and Return service. Should you wish to receive a paper receipt, please inform the Central Online delivery service provider.</li>
                <li>You confirm that your information, such as name, address, and phone number, is correct and can be used to issue an E-receipt for this service. Central Online and the shipping provider are not required to verify the accuracy of the information you provide.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the inspection of the order is complete, you may accept or reject the delivery for one of the following reasons:
            <ul class="pl-6 list-disc">
                <li>The order was not placed by you</li>
                <li>The items received do not match what was ordered</li>
                <li>Items are defective</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you reject the order after inspection, it will be deemed canceled, and there will be no option for re-delivery. To purchase the item again, you must place a new order on the website.</li>
        <li>
            Partial acceptance of the order under this service is not allowed. If you wish to accept only part of the order, you must choose one of the following options:
            <ul class="pl-6 list-disc">
                <li>Reject the entire order and, if still interested, you must place a new order. For example, if you have ordered four T-shirts and upon inspection find one defective or the wrong size, you must reject the order for all four T-shirts. If you still wish to buy the T-shirt, you must place a new order on the website; or</li>
                <li>Accept the entire order and submit a request for a refund according to the return policy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When placing an order, you must provide a name that matches the bank account name to facilitate refunds. If the names do not match, you will need to request a refund through Central Onlineâ€™s customer service, which may take longer than usual to process.</li>
        <li>Once you accept the order, you will not be able to use the Check and Return service again. If you wish to return the order, you must submit a request for a refund according to the return policy.</li>
        <li>The Check and Return service is an additional service of Central Online and is subject to <a class="text-blue-500 underline" href="https://prod-web.central.co.th/en/terms-conditions">the Terms & Conditions of service</a> and other applicable policies of Central Online.
